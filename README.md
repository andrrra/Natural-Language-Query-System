# A-Natural-Language-Query-System-in-Python-NLTK
Dialogue system that allows you to submit some simple facts and then ask questions about them. 

Sentences submitted by the user are either statements or questions. Statements have a very simple form, but the system uses them to learn what words are in the language and what parts of speech they have. Questions can have a much more complex form, but can only use words and names that the system has already learned from the statements it has seen.
