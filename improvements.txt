One way to improve the current system would be if a noun would be able to take
more attributes than one at once, so that instead of adding e.g.:
  $$ John is a duck.
  $$ John is orange.
we could simply type in:
  $$ John in an orange duck.

Another improvement could be adding more function words, such as "THAT" so that
the question "Who is an orange duck and likes Mary?" could also be written as
"Who is an orange duck that likes Mary?". On top of that, the system does not
currently allow for negations, such as
  $$ John is not a duck.
"NOT" could be added to the function words list and the grammar could be updated
implement this change. We could also use tokenization to implement this, by
normalize "didn't" form to two separate forms: did and nâ€™t, or not. We can do
this work with the help of a lookup table.

Another limitation of the system is that verbs such as "like" require a proper
name after them in order for the sentence to be parsed. This could be extended
to also work for common nouns, such that sentences like:
  $$ John likes ducks.
could be parsed.

These improvements would not be very difficult to implement and their benefits
would be user-related, more specifically, people using the dialogue system would
feel less constrained by the grammar that needs to be used and the specific
words they need to type in, in order for the system to provide the answers they
were looking for.
